  <h1>ASSIGNMENT1 CIS 1250 DAMANKUMAR</h1>
  <p>The process through which software making is divided into different steps and sub-processes either to make the task more organized or to improve the design and the product is termed as Software Development. This process contains five to six main stages: -

•	REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
It is the first and basic step to proceed toward the task of software development. Gathering related requirements as per the project is key to getting relevant software. Requirements can be of any type, like availability of tools, budget, communication with peers, time required, etc.

•	SOFTWARE DESIGNING
It is another sub-process through which the problems are transferred into an instruction sheet which helps in the planning or developing of software.

•	IMPLEMENTATION
The design implementation happens with the help of coding and programming skills.

•	TESTING
To avoid errors, the code must be verified for further processing.

•	MAINTAINANCE
The client should understand the system and must know how to operate it.

•	There are also a few techniques that might assist one in this process. For instance, Agile Software Development.

  <p>Software design is indispensable because it is an integral phase in software development. It is a technique through which we can design a meaningful representation or a type of protocol for something that we want to build. This process translates the requirements of software (SRS) into a blueprint for creating software, and the blueprint gives us the complete details of the working of software. The design must meet all the user requirements. If there are minor mistakes, carelessness and errors in the documents (requirements) and design, it will lead to an irrelevant output or can build undesired software.
As we know, if one wants to build or construct a house or building, one requires a map or a kind of instructions which should be precise, correct and according to the demand of the owner, similarly, this condition applies at every step of designing any software. In a nutshell, designing is a path towards better software development.

  <p> For the past 15 days, I’ve been using a software called Google Maps that is designed in such a way to help people get directions for anything at any time. Once it gets connected to the internet, it allows the user to find the most suitable path to reach the desired destination and is very easy to operate.</p>

  <h2>ASSIGNMENT2 CIS 1250 DAMANKUMAR</h2>
  <p>As we know the requirement gathering stage is the first step of software development and all necessary tasks and analysis regarding the project begin with assembling the requisite or by knowing the demands of the customer. A customer approaches the team first and then expresses his or her requirement, target, and desired software kind. Team members then examine or investigate the requirements ensuring that everything should be included in the software without causing breaks or problems to the system. The requirements are then finalized and listed in a specification document and moved on to the next stage of software development.

This stage is crucial since it helps the team to be aligned with the objective and goal of the project and lets them resolve the problems that might arise in upcoming steps of software development. Moreover, it helps the design team to understand the needs specified.

1.	As a hodophile, I want to travel to different locations and places, so that I can get navigation anytime and anywhere.
2.	As a travel agent, I want to be informed about the scenes and sites, so that I can book tickets accordingly.
3.	As a student, I want to be punctual for my classes, so that I can know the bus timings to commute.
4.	As a gourmet, I want to try different meals and drinks, so that I can get the best recommendations for restaurants or cafes near me.
5.	As a business administrator, I want to expand my business operations and location, so that I can showcase my business virtually.

  <h3>ASSIGNMENT3 CIS 1250 DAMANKUMAR</h3>
  <p>Empathy is the understanding of the feelings and needs of the user or client to 
solve the problem that they are facing. It is done to provide a compelling customer 
experience. Elements of empathy are:
1. Participation: This involves the development of genuine empathy by the 
members' contributions towards the user's concerns and issues.
2. Observation: This element allows the team to understand the user interaction 
with the system.
3. Developing trust: This involves building honesty among the customers. This 
helps the organization make its empathic understanding stronger.
4. Data capture: gathering information about the system, like what else should be 
in the software or what should not be, from different sources like feedback, 
observation, complaints, etc.
5. Redesigning: Updating the system in such a way that would create (a type of 
prototype) a sense of self-belongingness (solution) between the customer and the 
organization, for instance, NewsCo had launched t-shirts with a special message 
printed on them.
1. Consumers, literally
This business model was considered worst by the textbook as it only sees 
people(customers) as consumers. This is mainly used for generating profit which 
directly showcases the lack of respect for the customers. Moreover, the absence of 
understanding of the customer’s nature and quality of the products and services is 
negligible(observation).
2. Creating sheep:
Customers are easily influenced by the unique unreal design of a product which 
creates a gap between marketing skills and actual product design. Honesty should 
exist in every model for forever connection between customers and organization.
3. Unable to concentrate:
In the old models, the main focus was generally on the results and process rather 
than human services and products. Redesigning as the element of empathy is 
absent in this model because it needs more focus and usability</p>
