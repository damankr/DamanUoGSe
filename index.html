  <h1>ASSIGNMENT1 CIS 1250 DAMANKUMAR</h1>
  <p>The process through which software making is divided into different steps and sub-processes either to make the task more organized or to improve the design and the product is termed as Software Development. This process contains five to six main stages: <br>-

•	REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS<br>
It is the first and basic step to proceed toward the task of software development. Gathering related requirements as per the project is key to getting relevant software. Requirements can be of any type, like availability of tools, budget, communication with peers, time required, etc.
<br>
•	SOFTWARE DESIGNING<br>
It is another sub-process through which the problems are transferred into an instruction sheet which helps in the planning or developing of software.
<br>
•	IMPLEMENTATION<br>
The design implementation happens with the help of coding and programming skills.
<br>
•	TESTING<br>
To avoid errors, the code must be verified for further processing.
<br>
•	MAINTAINANCE<br>
The client should understand the system and must know how to operate it.
<br>
•	There are also a few techniques that might assist one in this process. For instance, Agile Software Development. 
</p><br>
  <p>Software design is indispensable because it is an integral phase in software development. It is a technique through which we can design a meaningful representation or a type of protocol for something that we want to build. This process translates the requirements of software (SRS) into a blueprint for creating software, and the blueprint gives us the complete details of the working of software. The design must meet all the user requirements. If there are minor mistakes, carelessness and errors in the documents (requirements) and design, it will lead to an irrelevant output or can build undesired software.
As we know, if one wants to build or construct a house or building, one requires a map or a kind of instructions which should be precise, correct and according to the demand of the owner, similarly, this condition applies at every step of designing any software. In a nutshell, designing is a path towards better software development.
</p><br><br>
  <p> For the past 15 days, I’ve been using a software called Google Maps that is designed in such a way to help people get directions for anything at any time. Once it gets connected to the internet, it allows the user to find the most suitable path to reach the desired destination and is very easy to operate.</p>

  <h1>ASSIGNMENT2 </h1>
  <p>As we know the requirement gathering stage is the first step of software development and all necessary tasks and analysis regarding the project begin with assembling the requisite or by knowing the demands of the customer. A customer approaches the team first and then expresses his or her requirement, target, and desired software kind. Team members then examine or investigate the requirements ensuring that everything should be included in the software without causing breaks or problems to the system. The requirements are then finalized and listed in a specification document and moved on to the next stage of software development.

This stage is crucial since it helps the team to be aligned with the objective and goal of the project and lets them resolve the problems that might arise in upcoming steps of software development. Moreover, it helps the design team to understand the needs specified.

1.	As a hodophile, I want to travel to different locations and places, so that I can get navigation anytime and anywhere.<br>
2.	As a travel agent, I want to be informed about the scenes and sites, so that I can book tickets accordingly.<br>
3.	As a student, I want to be punctual for my classes, so that I can know the bus timings to commute.<br>
4.	As a gourmet, I want to try different meals and drinks, so that I can get the best recommendations for restaurants or cafes near me.<br>
5.	As a business administrator, I want to expand my business operations and location, so that I can showcase my business virtually.<br>

  <h1>ASSIGNMENT3 </h1>
  <p>Empathy is the understanding of the feelings and needs of the user or client to 
solve the problem that they are facing. It is done to provide a compelling customer 
experience. Elements of empathy are:<br>
1. Participation: This involves the development of genuine empathy by the 
members' contributions towards the user's concerns and issues.<br>
2. Observation: This element allows the team to understand the user interaction 
with the system.<br>
3. Developing trust: This involves building honesty among the customers. This 
helps the organization make its empathic understanding stronger.<br>
4. Data capture: gathering information about the system, like what else should be 
in the software or what should not be, from different sources like feedback, 
observation, complaints, etc.<br>
5. Redesigning: Updating the system in such a way that would create (a type of 
prototype) a sense of self-belongingness (solution) between the customer and the 
organization, for instance, NewsCo had launched t-shirts with a special message 
printed on them.<br>
    
1. Consumers, literally<br>
This business model was considered worst by the textbook as it only sees 
people(customers) as consumers. This is mainly used for generating profit which 
directly showcases the lack of respect for the customers. Moreover, the absence of 
understanding of the customer’s nature and quality of the products and services is 
negligible(observation).<br>
2. Creating sheep:<br>
Customers are easily influenced by the unique unreal design of a product which 
creates a gap between marketing skills and actual product design. Honesty should 
exist in every model for forever connection between customers and organization.<br>
3. Unable to concentrate:<br>
In the old models, the main focus was generally on the results and process rather 
than human services and products. Redesigning as the element of empathy is 
absent in this model because it needs more focus and usability<br><br></p>


  
<h1> ASSIGNMENT 4 </h1>
    
  <P>
    <B>PRODUCT OR EXPERIENCE</B><BR>
This mainly describes how bigger or well-known companies put more significance in understanding customers (users) need and do monitoring to improve the user experience. Therefore, the real competition is always in updating and modifying the observation according to the product development.
George Eastman, the founder of Kodak (camera). His marketing strategy was based on clear and simplified photographic process for the users. His Slogan “You press the button, we do the rest,” made a convenient photographic experience for the customers.
This whole process of making a simpler camera, included loading the camera, exposing light-sensitive material, processing it, and printing images which directly showed that this is not simple.<BR>
Then, Eastman’s innovation transferred these complicated steps to a processing plant through which customers were allowed to send their recordings or film there for further development and printing. The consequence of this made users to only focus on capturing images. This thing made Kodak’s camera unremarkable and easy to use. 
This was not all, Eastman’s ambition was not only to provide or sell a promising product however, to build a strong ongoing relationship with his customers, he extended his vision and thought to deliver an ideal customer experience. In view to this fact, he had to invest in a specific factory that held the work of handling complex processing and printing tasks. <BR>
In the nutshell, Eastman changed the game by combining his product into a larger system. This strategy opened the gateway to the offered service through Kodak’s simple camera. Therefore, the key to design product is not only designing it but to understand what people want and what fits their need.<BR><BR>

  <h1>ASSIGNMENT 5 </h1>
  <P>In software design, Prototyping is a type of approach or a method that enables the team to make an early working model of the software asked by the user that exactly looks like the final product and is based on the requirements with limited functionalities and low reliability. This is generally used to gather feedback or refine the design before the final product is developed because once the final product is developed, it would be a hardship for the team to redesign it, so to resolve this problem prototyping is done to avoid any future inconvenience regarding the software. <br>

This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is achieved. Moreover, developing prototypes help in building a better actual design as it leads to exploring several design options throughout the process by identifying the strength and weakness of the solution. It is very normal for a customer to change the requirements after experiencing various prototypes made by the team. <be>
<BR>Key benefits of using prototypes in software development: - <br>
•	Prototype acts as a communication tool as it inspires “ownership”, as users feel like they are co-designers in the process because it allows users to interact with the system early in the development process so that the team can get relatable feedback. <br>
•	Prototyping helps in improving design according to the feedback. <br>
•	Also, one of the major benefits is that it helps reduce the development effort since it is more cost-efficient than directly making an actual design (saves more). <br>


To do paper prototyping <br>
1.	Gathering supplies like pens, sketches, paper etc. <br>
2.	Create a list of tasks to be done by the user. <br>
3.	Choose the most important user for the interface. <br>
4.	Evaluate the prototype. <br>
5.	Perform a usability test (require facilitator, human-computer actor, note taker). <br>

The goal of utilizing paper prototyping is to help design teams to design a better product with user experience over multiple solutions.

    <h1>ASSIGNMENT 6 </h1>
<br><br><p>Communication is an integral aspect of software development. Good communication helps to understand client needs and how well the team or a person works on it. As we know software engineer has to talk to different clients of different nature with different behaviour where communication plays a pivotal role. Moreover, in the development process, it is very effective in all the stages for instance during the requirement gathering stage, an impressive interview or asking questions requires prominent communication when designing a prototype or brainstorming it acts as a key to making tasks better or improves interaction and conversation between peers.
<br><br>
The three key elements of effective communication:<br>
<br>
•	Be mindful and culturally sensitive:  Staying mindful will help one to welcome good        thoughts, generate ideas and encourage other peers also there are different cultural contexts in this modern era and by considering this one should be attentive while putting a point related to any culture so that it wouldn’t hurt or defame any other culture.
 <br>
•	Be flexible and empathetic: Try to adapt to the situation as it leads to understanding things more effectively. Keep moving further to find new or better solutions for development. Interaction and focusing on the current project show how active a person is. 
 <br>
•	Clarity:  Be calm during any communication as anger or pressure can lead to conflict or can make the conversation not interesting which may result in the company's reputation. Learn to listen and try to understand everyone’s perspective. Furthermore, try to keep honesty in your answers don’t say okay to everything otherwise it can deviate from the actual goal of the project.
 <br>
<br>
Personal experience;<br>
I have encountered, there was an instance where a lack of communication led to the development of a different project not according to the client’s expectation. Looking back, I understand this could have been avoided by asking targeted questions (perfectly rephrase) to know what the client needs and also should have used the key elements listed above would helped in avoiding ambiguity.

  <h1>ASSIGNMENT 7</h1>
  <P>The design principle that we discussed is:<BR>

 <B>The 80/20 Rule (The Pareto Principle)</B>: -<BR>
 This principle states that for almost every situation, 80% of the outcomes or consequence comes from 20% of input, efforts, resources used etc. and vice versa. In the context of software design, It plays a significant role in various processes of software development, such as feature development, bug fixing, prototyping, generating ideas and time management. For example, 
Software Developers should have 20% of the sample review to get 80% user satisfaction with the products. 
 80% of defects in the product come from the 20% of the feature and vice-versa.<BR>
20% of code creates 80% of bugs. <BR>
Therefore, developers should focus on fixing and identifying those bugs to reduce the risk of errors and failures. Their focus should be on 20%. 
 <BR><BR>
When I was in high school, I was given a project to make a website so, I started coding for that and then I noticed that my focus or ambition was only on doing programming, which sometimes didn’t lead to the desired output. Finally, I remembered the Pareto principle and used it which made my project effective. I realized that only doing 20% of coding and debugging the rest 80% made things better like correct coding with no errors.
 <BR
Another example is related to an educational website that is very easy and convenient to operate without any complexity as it has a satisfying design that anyone can understand.
From that, I can relate that 20% of the simplicity and usability of the product can generate 80% satisfaction and user consistency in that product.

    <h1>ASSIGNMENT 7</h1>
<P>Answers are according to the links shared and content in the lecture.<BR>

<B>SNEAKING:</B> “The user falls into the trick of false or fraud transaction since the true information or legal steps gets hidden or disappears to them ”
<BR>
This deceptive technique involves promoting or adding more products or services to a user’s order or e-cart without asking the user to add or update the order list. A website might, for instance, automatically choose to add hidden charges to the total price, or it might provide the opportunity to purchase avoidable insurance, a guarantee, or an unwanted subscription with the primary item. In many cases, this kind of behaviour violates the moral standards outlined in the ACM code of ethics.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>PRINCIPLES:</B><BR>

1) BE HONEST AND TRUSTWORTHY<br>
<BR></BR>Honesty is an essential component of trustworthiness, which states that the developer should be honest in their representations, disclose any potential conflicts of interest, and avoid deceptive or fraudulent practices. The sneaking pattern is dishonest and deceptive as it misleads the user into buying or paying for something they did not intend to, and it may also create a conflict of interest between the seller and the buyer which can result in losing trust in that service.
<Br>
2) HONOR CONFIDENTIALITY
<BR><BR>         This sneaking pattern violates the principle of respecting the privacy of others, which indicates that computing professionals should protect the confidentiality and privacy of personal data and use it for reasonable and authorized purposes. The sneaking may involve collecting, storing, or using the user’s financial and personal information without the consent of the user’s awareness and may also expose them to security risks or identity theft.
