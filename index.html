  <p>The process through which software making is divided into different steps and sub-processes either to make the task more organized or to improve the design and the product is termed as Software Development. This process contains five to six main stages: -

•	REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
It is the first and basic step to proceed toward the task of software development. Gathering related requirements as per the project is key to getting relevant software. Requirements can be of any type, like availability of tools, budget, communication with peers, time required, etc.

•	SOFTWARE DESIGNING
It is another sub-process through which the problems are transferred into an instruction sheet which helps in the planning or developing of software.

•	IMPLEMENTATION
The design implementation happens with the help of coding and programming skills.

•	TESTING
To avoid errors, the code must be verified for further processing.

•	MAINTAINANCE
The client should understand the system and must know how to operate it.

•	There are also a few techniques that might assist one in this process. For instance, Agile Software Development.

  <p>Software design is indispensable because it is an integral phase in software development. It is a technique through which we can design a meaningful representation or a type of protocol for something that we want to build. This process translates the requirements of software (SRS) into a blueprint for creating software, and the blueprint gives us the complete details of the working of software. The design must meet all the user requirements. If there are minor mistakes, carelessness and errors in the documents (requirements) and design, it will lead to an irrelevant output or can build undesired software.
As we know, if one wants to build or construct a house or building, one requires a map or a kind of instructions which should be precise, correct and according to the demand of the owner, similarly, this condition applies at every step of designing any software. In a nutshell, designing is a path towards better software development.

  <p> For the past 15 days, I’ve been using a software called Google Maps that is designed in such a way to help people get directions for anything at any time. Once it gets connected to the internet, it allows the user to find the most suitable path to reach the desired destination and is very easy to operate.</p>
